TO DO:
    - Verify that we are writing down the Paulis in the correct order (i.e., should an XY error on qubits 0 and 1 be "XY" or "YX"? This has implications for interfacing with Ashe's code and for the layer snipper.)
    - Write unit tests for ml.newtools.up_to_weight_k_error_gens_from_qubit_graph
